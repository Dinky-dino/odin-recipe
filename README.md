I will be creating a basic recipe site as part of TheOdinProject course.
In this site it will contain a main Web page linking to at least 3 different recipe pages, with images and lists.
Hopfully by the end I will be able to show off my current use of HTML, and later use of CSS to make the site 'prettier'.
