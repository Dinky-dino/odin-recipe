    <h3>Pancakes with syrup and butter</h3>
        <p1>A simple recipe for scotch/american style pancakes, fluffy and unsweetened, with the option of additional syrup and butter (or any sweetening of your choice!).</p1>

        <p2>The recipe follows a 1:1:1 ratio by weight of ingridents and should make atleast 4 pancakes. On average a large egg out of its shell is roughly 60g.</p2>

        <p3>(This recipe can be altered to create a bigger batch of batter)</p3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>60g of egg</li>
            <li>60g of flour</li>
            <li>60g of milk</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Seperate egg whites and yolk, whisk the whites till they form soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Add the egg yolks to the flour. Incorporate milk to the flour slowly creating a even batter with a few lumps (don't worry these lumps create the fluffyness of the pancakes!)</li>
            <li>Slowly but steadly incorporate the whisked egg whites to the batter, gently folding the mixture into itself.</li>
            <li>Use a ladle to scoop the batter, place on to a hot pan, pregreaced with butter.</li>
            <li>Keep an eye on the pancakes, flip once bubbles start to pop and a brown crust has formed. Remove from heat once both sides have been cooked.</li>
            <li>Stack pancakes high on a plate and serve with butter and maple syrup. (or any sweet toppings of your choice) </li>
        </ol>
